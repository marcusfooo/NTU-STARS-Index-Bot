A cheeky bot I developed to automate class index changes for the NTU STARS module system.
Simple and easy setup.
Built using Python, Selenium and GeckoDriver

For users who wish to run the script on their personal computer, simply clone this repo and download the latest
geckodriver executable file within the same directory. Ensure that you have stable versions of Mozilla Firefox and
Python installed on your device. Simply run the cli_app.py file and follow the steps.

For users who wish to run the script on a cloud or VM, use the cloud_app.py instead. I personally use DigitalOcean but
feel free to explore alternatives like Heroku and AWS. Setup is similar to the CLI version, just make sure you have
pyvirtualdisplay as an installed dependency for the cloud setup to work.

Disclaimer: This was meant as a fun pet project and is by no means meant to be abused/ distributed. Use this solely as
a learning tool. I take no responsibility for any outcomes resulting from the use of this script.
